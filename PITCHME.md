## Visio

Visio helps visually impaired people understand and feel what their friends are sharing with the world!
Made during Hack in the north 2017.

### Current Scenario and the solution

Visually impaired people don't have the freedom to listen and understand the news around 
them that the world is sharing.

Currently, visually impaired people have to depend on news channels which doesn't give 
them freedom of choice. We want to give them this freedom by choosing what they want 
to listen and understanding the context behind it.

We use Artificial Intelligence, image and sentiment analysis and text-to-speech technology to analyse what's going 
around the world and give this understanding to our user in the easiest possible way.

### How it can be used

As we wanted to make the lives simpler for visually impaired people, we trusted on the most basic and elegant 
form of input for them, which is braille.

```
The simplest solution is the most elegant one!
```

Our user will use their braille keyboard to access our website which will instantly give back a solid understanding 
of what's going around the world. As we are accessing the latest feed from twitter, the user has the freedom 
to choose what they want to listen to and what they don't.

```
We aim to make the world more open and connected and that goes for everyone
```

#### Technology

The project uses node.js as the backend and embedded javascript as the view engine along with [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/)'s  REST API for data fetches.

#### Future

We plan to extend our product to consume more sources of information, provide context analysis on videos and 
give more options to the end user to provide them more freedom and convenience.
